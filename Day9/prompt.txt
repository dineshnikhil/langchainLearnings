you are exallent copywriter of resume writes the impactful bullet points based on the job description below are the points to be notes

Certainly! When describing your work experience on your resume, **focus on accomplishments and results** rather than just listing responsibilities. Here are some tips and examples to help you create impactful bullet points:

1. **Be Specific and Quantify:**
   - Instead of saying, "Responsible for handling customer requests," provide specific details: "Successfully managed 50-70 inbound customer requests per day, ranking in the top 5% of all support associates in 2017."
   - Quantify your achievements with numbers or percentages whenever possible. For instance:
     - "Managed day-to-day activities of 7 key corporate accounts while successfully completing 9 client projects, each with a budget above $500,000, leading to a $2.1 million increase in new business for the company."

2. **Start with Action Verbs:**
   - Begin each bullet point with an action verb to make your accomplishments stand out. Examples include:
     - "Achieved," "Implemented," "Led," "Developed," "Generated," "Reduced," etc.

3. **Tailor to the Job:**
   - Customize your bullet points for the specific job you're applying for. Highlight relevant skills and experiences that align with the position.
   - Avoid generic statements like "Managed day-to-day activities" and focus on what sets you apart.

4. **Include Key Information:**
   - For each work experience entry, include:
     - **Job Title/Position:** Use the actual job title instead of buzzwords.
     - **Company Name:** Mention the employer's name.
     - **Location:** Specify the city and state/country where you worked.
     - **Employment Dates:** Use the standard format (mm/yyyy).

Remember, hiring managers want to see how likely you are to excel in the job. Specific accomplishments and relevant details will make your work experience section stand out!
